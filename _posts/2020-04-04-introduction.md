title: Hello from Wisconsin...
---
...where I teach and research all things Thomas Aquinas at Marquette University. This site hosts the latest about my work.

For most things see my [profile on Academia.edu](https://marquette.academia.edu/mfjohnson). On this site you can see the following:

- [Blog](/blog): At heart a blog is a web log. Mine focuses me on my committments. Opinions optional.
- [Curriculum vitae](/cv): An obituary account of what I have done in print, including a decade-long swoon in publishing.
- [Projects](/projects): What hoists me out of bed in the morning. Gonna get after it.
- [Archive](/archive): My old blogâ€™s contents, with opinion pieces about then-current affairs and Marquette. Not doing that anymore.
